## 🎓 The Graph: Our Education Mission

[The Graph](https://thegraph.com/) is the indexing and query layer of web3. Developers build and publish open APIs, called subgraphs, that applications can query using GraphQL. The Graph aims to support the next generation of dapp developers in harnessing the power of blockchain data to bring a superior experience for their users.

The Graph currently supports indexing data from over 40 different networks including Ethereum, NEAR, Arbitrum, Optimism, ZkSync, Polygon, Avalanche, Celo, Fantom, Moonbeam, IPFS, Cosmos Hub and PoA with more networks coming soon. Tens of thousands of developers use The Graph for applications such as Uniswap, Synthetix, KnownOrigin, Art Blocks, Gnosis, Balancer, Livepeer, DAOstack, Audius, Decentraland, and many others.

## 🧱 Why you need The Graph?

If you are building a dapp to contribute to the foundation of the decentralised future, here’s why you using The Graph to build subgraphs to power your next dapp with blockchain data:

1. Subgraphs bring the world’s data to your fingertips by serving as an API layer that sits between your UI & data layer.
2. Dapps need indexed application data for robust UI/UX. Subgraphs are the de-facto standard for serving blockchain data to your dapps in a decentralised & efficient way.
3. You can perform complex queries on blockchain data like joins, filtering, sorting, pagination, etc. & query it from your frontend.
4. Proprietary indexing servers are cost & resource heavy; not to mention error-prone and centralised. The Graph decentralised network is an open & transparent network of participants making data accessible to developers.
